## Instructions

To get started, let's install our dependencies:

```console
$ npm install
```
Before moving ahead, open
[http://localhost:4000/items](http://localhost:4000/items) in the browser and
familiarize yourself with the data. What are the important keys on each object?

Leave `json-server` running. Open a new terminal, and run React with:

```console
$ npm start
```

View the application in the browser at
[http://localhost:3010](http://localhost:3010). We don't have any data to
display yet, but eventually, we'll want to display the list of items from  our application and be able to perform CRUD actions on them.
